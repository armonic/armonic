Requires:
	Add mulitplicity parameters
	Add variable type checking
	Add choice value for variables

	Add a kind of variables set by the provide return value


States: 
	Add a info method.  Suppose a chooseTemplate state. The info
	method could return the template in order to know what it is
	exactly.  This cannot be done with provide because when you
	call a provide, its state must be in the stack and we don't
	want that know a template before applying it.

	Add a check method. This method try to know if this state is
	already applied or not. This is useful to restart the
	mss-agent and go back to the correct state.


Multithread:
	It should be possible to launch several module in parallel.
	Concerning logging, you could add filter on thread id to avoid redirection of all messages to all clients.

State machine initialization:
      Simple way: status of state machine are saved in a file and restore when agent is started

      Safe way: we use a file to save status of state
      machines. Moreover, each state could have a 'check' method that
      try to know if it is already applied. For instance,
      SystemdActive check method does a systemctl status service to
      know if service is already started or not.
      

Augeas:
	It is currently hard to comment/uncomment. Maybe rename command could be used to do this.
