- Fill methods (Provide, Require) are not really strong. We have to
  think more about them, especially how a variable xpath is expanded
  to an absolute xpath. We also have to detect if a variable matches
  several expanded xpath. Currently, I think it can be a problem if it
  happens.


- Require API with source and uuid for deployment tracking:

  LifecycleManager should have methods signature such as
    provide_call(xpath, requires, path_idx=0, source=None, uuid=None)
    state_goto(xpath, requires, path_idx=0, source=None, uuid=None)
  
  Then, we could introduce a new objet Submit (a better name is
  needed) which contains requires, sources and uuid. This object would
  be built by LFM methods and passed to Lifecycle methods.

  The method format_input_variable could be a member of this object.


- Deserialize sent objects on client side and have clean shared class
  between agents and clients.
